## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

The motivation behind the ReFood project is simple: to create an application for Romanian restaurants and bakeries where they can sell the products that are not good enough to sell at a full price and otherwise would be thrown out. By taking part in this project not only could they reduce general waste, but also their ecological footprint. 

Also, this application could benefit people with a lower income, who have less time to cook. This way students would be the main target group. They are more likely to look for deals to save money and they would probably be more open to the idea of eating food that would have gone to waste.
